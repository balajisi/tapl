Types and Programming Languages Implementations in Scala
==========

Right now, only Arith is implemented, and most of the code for that is taken from [Bastien Louerat's Implementation](https://github.com/blouerat/arith/). The major difference being the Arith parser in this implementation is done using [Parboiled2](https://github.com/sirthias/parboiled2).

This repository is a work in progress and will get updated regularly with other implementations as I complete the chapters one-by-one.

Next up, the Untyped Lambda Calculus.
